This project is a professional portfolio that illustrates my skills and achievements as a web and print graphic designer, UI UX designer.

It is hosted on GitHub, the reference platform for developers around the world.

I used HTML (40%), CSS (30%), Bootstrap (15%) and JavaScript (15%) technologies to create this portfolio. I also used Figma to create the dynamic mockup and prototype of the portfolio.

The portfolio is responsive, meaning it adapts to the size and orientation of the visitorâ€™s screen. It has several sections:
A welcome section with a background animation in CSS which presents me and my job. As well as a contact button that opens the visitor's email with my pre-filled email address.

A skills section with animated icons on hover in CSS
which show my areas of expertise.

A section presenting my creations with images of projects classified by category (web, print, UI UX).

A contact section that sends visitor entered data to my email address via AJAX request.

The portfolio is designed to highlight my work and my know-how in UI UX design and web and print graphics.
It reflects my image and presents my work. It aims to attract the attention and interest of IT professionals who are looking for a competent and creative web and print graphic designer, UI UX designer.
